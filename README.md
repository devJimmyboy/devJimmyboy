### I have **several** projects I'm working on. I can't seem to finish a single one!
  - [Team Manager](https://github.com/devJimmyboy/Team-Manager), a discord bot for automatically handling teams/groups in a folder. eg 
  - A [Twitch Chat App](https://github.com/devJimmyboy/twitch-chat-app) that may not get finished since I just wanted to check out Electron.
  - A Twitch Extension called [Polls Plus](https://github.com/devJimmyboy/) that served as my first real endeavour into web development.
    #### Private/Non-Github Projects (*for now*):
  - Twitch streaming "suite" with a control panel and many chat interactions
    - Also making a personal overlay through the power of **Unity WebGL** and **OBS Browser Sources** on my [Twitch Channel](https://www.twitch.tv/devJimmyboy).
  - Chat Bot to link communication between Groupme chats and Discord. Wanting to expand on this, too, like implementing Slack

### Resources I recommend:
- [Medium.com](https://medium.com), a website where developers everywhere can publish articles about any subject.
- [CodePen.io](https://codepen.io/trending) or [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/), small snippets of webcode to gain inspiration or to share your own work.
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) or [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), two frameworks that both are based around components. I started with React, since vanilla Javascript can be too much to bear sometimes.
